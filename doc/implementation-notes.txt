  CVS/RCS ==> Git Conversion
  ==========================

Introduction
------------

  * RCS
    - Revision Control System.
    - Common work area.
    - File based.
    - File locking.

  * CVS
    - Concurrent Version System.
    - Initially (before version 1.10) implemented on top of RCS.
    - Multiple work areas (typically one per user).
    - File based.
    - No locking.

  * Git
    - Version control system implemented by Linus Torvalds
      when he tired of all others.
    - Distributed - All nodes have (potentially) all information.
    - Branched development; every checkout has its own set of branches.
    - Under rapid development.


Comparison of CVS/RCS vs Git(1)
-------------------------------

  Attributes kept track of by CVS

  * A revision contains:
    - File content
    - Committer
    - Commit time
    - Commit message
    - Related commits

  * Non-version controlled attributes:
    - Tags
    - Expansion mode flags
    - Mode flags
    - (Locks)
    - Vendor branch switches

  * Special files
    - .cvsignore
    - ($CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules)

  * Tags
    - Associate names with specific revisions
      of one or more files (1-N).


Comparison of CVS/RCS vs Git(2)
-------------------------------

  Attributes kept track of by Git

  * A commit contains:
    - A git tree
    - A (possibly empty) set of parent commits
    - Committer
    - Commit time
    - Author
    - Authoring time
    - Commit message

  * A tree maps file names to content:
    - Files
      * A file has a content (blob) and a protection mode
        (either 0100644 or 0100755).
    - Directories (trees)
    - (Symlinks)
    - (Git links)

  * Special files
    - .gitignore
    - .gitattributes
    - .git/info/attributes

  * Tags (light-weight)
    - Associate names with specific commits (1-1).


Existing tools
--------------

  * git-cvsimport

    - Based on cvsps.
    - Support for incremental import.
    - Not robust against strange timestamp orders.
    - Empty branches are not imported.
    - Multiple tags on the same revision are not imported.
    - Tags may move between revisions if there isn't
      a unique git commit that matches the tag.

  * cvs2git (part of svn2git)

  * parsecvs


The Problem
-----------

  How to convert from CVS/RCS to Git with maximum fidelity?

  A forrest of file revisions ==> A DAG of commits.


The Solution
------------

  * Read the CVS/RCS files.
  * Perform some magic.
  * Write a Git repository.


Reading CVS/RCS Files
---------------------

  * rlog/co (RCS)
    - Slow (one fork(1)/revision and file).
  * Parser.RCS (Pike)
    - Faster (~150 revisions/s).


Performing Some Magic(1)
------------------------

  * Convert each CVS/RCS file individually, and add spanning
    commits for the tags and branches.

  Note: We now have a valid git repository, but it isn't
        very useful, since all non-tag commits only contain
        a single file.


Performing Some Magic(2)
------------------------

  To make the converted repository more useful we perform the
  following two transformations:

  * Merge commits that have the same commit time and message
    and committer and contain different files.
  * Linearize the commit history.

  Both of the above have the additional restriction that they
  must not move any tags.


Performing Some Magic(3)
------------------------

  How to keep track of the tag restriction?

  * Assign two colors to each of the commit nodes:
    - The set of tags from which this node is known to be
      reachable via the parent relation (leaves).
    - The set of tags from which this node is known to not
      be reachable via the parent relation (dead leaves).


Performing Some Magic(4)
------------------------

  * Merge case:
    - Check that leaves and dead leaves don't intersect.
    - The set of leaves for the merged node is the
      union of the two sets of leaves.
    - The set of dead leaves for the merged node is the
      union of the two sets of dead leaves.

  * Linearization case:
    - Check that the dead leaves of the parent doesn't
      intersect with the leaves of the child.
    - Extend the set of leaves for the parent with the
      set of leaves from the child.
    - Extend the set of dead leaves for the child with
      the set of dead leaves from the parent.

  * In both cases:
    - Propagate leaves toward the parents.
    - Propagate dead leaves toward the children.


Basic Graph Operations(1)
-------------------------

  * Add an inferred parent-child relation.

                +-+ +-+ +-+            +-+ +-+ +-+

  * Leaves from c are added to p.
  * Dead leaves from p are added to c.


Basic Graph Operations(2)

                +-+ +---+ +-+          +-+ +---+ +-+

  * The set of leaves is merged.
  * The set of dead leaves is merged.


Goal For Merging
----------------

  * Merge all nodes that were committed at the same time
    by the same committer and with the same commit message,
    while keeping the graph a DAG, and not moving any tags.


Issues During Merging
---------------------

  * CVS/RCS commits each file separately, which means that
    the timestamps for files that were committed "at the same
    time" may differ. This is especially true for commits
    performed on old machines with old versions of cvs.
    - Trade-off fidelity of commit time vs merging aggression.

  * Don't merge commits representing tags or branches until
    after the linearization is complete.
    - A tag commit initially has very few leaves (typically
      only itself), and often a small set of dead leaves
      as well. This means that tags before the linearization
      have a very high compatibility.

  * Make sure not to violate revision order and avoid generation
    of commit loops.


Algorithm For Merging(1)
------------------------

  * Perform a topological sort of the commits where commit time
    is taken into account.
  * For all commits c in topological order from oldest to newest do:
    - If c represents a tag or a branch skip to the next commit.
    - For all commits p older than c in topological order from newest
      to oldest do:
      * If c is a child of p break the inner loop.
      * If p is merge-compatible with c merge the two commits into c.


Algorithm For Merging(2)
------------------------

  * Caveat: Time in CVS/RCS isn't necessarily monotonically increasing.
  * Optimization: The inner loop can be terminated when the distance
    in time between the two commits is large enough.
  * Note: This algorithm will fail to merge some nodes (depending on the
    topological order) for some cases where several revisions occur in
    the same time interval for the same file. A common case is with the
    automatically generated commits for files added on branches. To
    alleviate this, perform the algorithm once more, but with the scan
    directions reversed.


Goal For Linearizing
--------------------

  * Create a minimum spanning DAG of the partial order relation
    described by the timestamps and the parent-child relations.


Issues During Linearizing
-------------------------

  * Make sure not to violate revision order and avoid generation
    of commit loops (keep true to the partial order relation).
  * Need to keep track of the set of successors so as to not generate
    excessive merge nodes (we want a minimum spanning tree).


Algorithm For Linearizing(1)
----------------------------

  * Perform a topological sort of the commits where commit time
    is taken into account as a secondary sort order.
  * For all commits p in topological order from newest to oldest do:
    - Create a node set of successors for p containing just p.
    - Clear the set of children for p.
    - For all commits c newer than p in topological order from oldest
      to newest:
      * If c is in the successor set of p skip to the next c.
      * If the intersection of leaves(c) and dead-leaves(p)
        is not empty skip to the next c.
      * Hook c as a child to p.
      * Extend the successor set for p with the successor set for c.
    - Clear the set of parents for p. We've kept them around to
      ensure that leaves from the children propagate properly.


Algorithm For Linearizing(2)

    Parents:    | |          | |
                +-+          +-+


Algorithm For Linearizing(3)
----------------------------

  * Caveat: Time in CVS/RCS isn't necessarily monotonically increasing.
  * Optimization: If the set of leaves for c is the same as the set
    of leaves for p, we can break the inner loop.
  * Optimization: Depending on the datatype selected for the successor
    set, it may be possible to swap the rule:
    - If c is in the successor set of p skip to the next c.
    with:
    - If c is in the successor set of p skip to the next c not in the
      successor set of p.

  * Note: Scan direction is important in this case. By scanning from
    newest to oldest, we won't run into trouble with the commits that
    have minimal sets of leaves (eg nodes representing dead files or
    tags), since they will otherwise accumulate an excessive amount
    of parents. This can be alleviated by performing an intermediate
    pass, but it's easier to just scan from newest to oldest.


Merging tags to commits
-----------------------

  * Often a tag commit has only a single parent commit. In that case
    it is possible to remove the tag commit, and just tag the parent
    directly.
    - Note: Removing nodes from the graph can introduce extraneous
      edges in the graph, which should be removed. Eg:

                +-+             +-+          +-+
    Children:   | |             | |          | |
                +-+             +-+          +-+
                / \             / \           |
              +-+ +-+         +-+  |         +-+
              | | |X|   ==>   | |  |   ==>   | |
              +-+ +-+         +-+  |         +-+
                \ /             \ /           |
                +-+             +-+          +-+
    Parents:    | |             | |          | |
                +-+             +-+          +-+


Exporting To Git(1)
-------------------

  * Approach #1:
    - Clear the git index with git-reset.
    - Copy the files to commit to their proper places in
      a temporary working tree.
    - Add the files to commit to the git index with git-add.
    - Use git-write-tree to generate a tree id from the git index.
    - Use git-commit-tree to generate the commits.
    - Use git-branch and git-tag to generate the references
      for the branches and tags.


Exporting To Git(2)
-------------------

  * Notes about approach #1:
    - Similar to the operations of a normal user.
    - Many fork(1) operations for each commit.
    - Data for files is fetched via the filesystem.
    - Slow (depending on process size and number of files ~5 commits/s).
  * Trivial ways to speed it up:
    - Keep track of what's in the git index and using "git-rm --cached",
      can speed it up to ~10 commits/s.
    - Specifying multiple files at once to git-add and git-rm can speed
      it up further to ~15 commits/s.


Exporting To Git(3)
-------------------

  * Approach #2:
    - Use git-hash-object to upload all the blobs to the git repository.
      This can be done in parallel with the graph processing.
    - Use git-update-index together with the blob ids generated above
      to update the git index.
    - Use git-write-tree, git-commit-tree and git-branch, git-tag as
      in approach #1 to generate the commits.


Exporting To Git(4)
-------------------

  * Notes about approach #2:
    - Lower level interface to Git.
    - Streaming interface via stdin/stdout.
    - Data for files can be uploaded separately from the commits
      (but still via the filesystem).
    - Filenames in git and in the temporary filesystem don't
      need to match.
    - 3 fork(1)'s per commit.
    - Faster (~20 commits/s).


Exporting To Git(5)
-------------------

  * Approach #3:
    - Start a git-fast-import process
    - Upload all the blobs to the git repository and associate them
      with markers using the blob command. This can be done in
      parallel with the graph processing, or during loading of the
      RCS files.
    - Use the commit command to generate the commits.
    - Use the reset command to create the tags and branches.


Exporting To Git(6)
-------------------

  * Notes about approach #3:
    - Special interface to Git intended for importers.
    - Fork once.
    - Streaming interface via stdin.
    - Data for files can be uploaded inline.
      ==> No need for any temporary files.
    - Fast (~200 commits/s).
    - Possible to save the intermediate ASCII-based format.
      ==> Easy to debug.

  * Uploading data:

# Creating two blobs.

  * Committing files:

# Committing

Git-Fast-Import Example(3)
--------------------------

  * Tagging commits:

# Creating the light-weight tag "root".
reset refs/tags/root
from :3

  * Flushing the importer state:

# Flush
checkpoint


Metadata conversion
-------------------

  * Executables
    In RCS and CVS the executable property is stored as a mode bit
    on the repository file, and is thus not version controlled
    (it is also only updated on the initial checkout/commit, so
    it may not be mirrored by the working tree). In git the property
    is version controlled.

  * .cvsignore
    .gitignore supports a true superset of .cvsignore. Note though
    that CVS has some implicit rules, that have to be made explicit
    in git.

  * Binary files, linefeed conversion and keyword expansion
    In RCS and CVS these are all properties of the repository file,
    and are not version controlled. In Git these properties may be
    version controlled via the .gitattributes file. Note though
    that Git only supports a single keyword for expansion - $Id$,
    and that keyword expansion is not enabled by default.


CVS/RCS Obscurities
-------------------

  * Dead commits
    - After a file has been killed, it won't receive any tags.

  * Vendor branches
    - Act as the main branch until the next commit.
    - Switches to the vendor branch are not version controlled.

  * Vendor branch import commit "Initial revision"
    - Added automatically by cvs import as revision 1.1.
    - Is identical except for commit message with the
      first commit on the vendor branch (revision 1.1.1.1).

  * Placeholder commit for files added initially on branches
    - Dead revision 1.1 "file %s was initially added on branch %s.".
    - Added automatically by cvs commit when creating a new
      file on a branch.


CVS Repository Problems
-----------------------

  * Copies of RCS files
    - CVS does not have a concept of renamed or copied files. It
      is thus common to copy the corresponding RCS file inside
      the repository to be able to maintain the history.

  * Branching by copying the repository
    - Since CVS's support for renaming operations and branches
      (in practise only the main branch is efficient) is lacking,
      it is common to copy the entire repository when creating
      a new major branch.
    

Common Conversion Issues
------------------------

  * What is expected to be one commit has split into multiple.
    - Missing deletions of files between main branches or
      missing renames of files.
      * Check what branches the different commits are on,
        and identify the transition the problematic commit
        defines, and investigate the files contained in
        the commit during that transition.
    - The fuzz factor is too low.
      * Increase the fuzz factor.

  * Tags that do not appear on a branch.
    - May be correct in some unusual circumstances.
    - The same tag has been used in multiple branches or
      for different purposes.
      * Identify the different uses, and use different names.
    - A forced split occurs too early.
      * Delay the split.

  * The default branch is not called "master".
    Git defaults to checking out the branch selected by HEAD, which
    in turn defaults to "refs/heads/master". If there's no branch
    named "master", git-clone(1) will have a partial failure. Changing
    the branch selected by HEAD can not (yet) be changed from within
    git-fast-import(1), but must be done with git-symbolic-ref(1).


Some Data
---------

  * Pike consists of 12 CVS repositories of which 9 have received
    committs the last year.
  * These repositories together contain ~65000 unique revisions
    and ~2000 tags spread over a period of ~14 years.
  * The configuration file for Pike contains ~1500 lines of code.
  * From this data pcvs2git constructs a Git repository with
    ~35000 commits in ~50 minutes.


Using pcvs2git(1)
-----------------

  * Keeps several of the options from git-cvsimport:

    -o, --branch
      Specifies the destination branch for HEAD.
    -h, --help
    -d
      Directory to import.
    -A, --authors
      Author conversion file.
    -C, --git-dir
      Output git repository.
    -z
      Fuzz factor in seconds.
    -k
      Kill keywords.
    -m
      Attempt to identify merges.
    -r, --remote
      The git remote to import into.


Using pcvs2git(2)
-----------------

  * And adds a few more:

    --contributors
      Specifies a file identifying revisions where the committer
      was not the actual author.
    -c, --config
      Specifies a configuration file.
    -p
      Pretend.
    -R, --root
      Specifies the root commit for the import.
    -q, --quiet
      Reduces the verbosity of the import.


Passes of cvs2git(1)
--------------------

  * Reading RCS files.
    - The RCS files are read.
    - The handler may identify renamed and copied files.
    - File contents are uploaded to git.

  * Raking leaves some more (optional).
    - The handler may use this eg for identifying files
      that were deleted between branches.

  * Untangling branches.
    - Main branches that aren't known to commits are added
      as dead leaves, to keep them from being attached to
      the other branches.


Passes of cvs2git(2)
--------------------

  * Checking if leaves are attached to branches.
    - Commits representing tags are checked that they are
      compatible with any of the branches.

  * Bumping timestamps.
    - Commits that have a timestamp that is earlier than
      any of their parents are bumped so that time is
      monotonically increasing.

  * Verifying initial state.
    - Various graph properties are verified.


Passes of cvs2git(3)
--------------------

  * Sorting.
    - Generates a total order of the commits.

  * Verifying commit tables.
    - Verifies that the total order has kept parent-child relation.

  * Merging.
    - Merges commits that are compatible.

  * Merging some more.
    - Same, but in the other direction.

  * Checking if leaves are attached to branches.
    - Same as before, in case the merges have affected anything.


Passes of cvs2git(4)
--------------------

  * Adjusting tags.
    - Adjusts the timestamps for the commits representing tags, so
      that they have a minimal distance to the most recent commit
      that they tag.

  * Bumping timestamps.
    - Same as before, in case the merges have affected anything.

  * Verifying commit tables.
    - Same as before.

  * Graphing.
    - Creates a minimum spanning graph.

  * Merging tags with commits.
    - Finds tag commits that have a single parent commit,
      and merges them with the parent commit.

  * Committing.
    - Commits the resulting graph to git.
